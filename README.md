# MODQPSO_training_FNN
The research is that MODQPSO can substitute Back Propagation to train FNN.
Multi-objective Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (MOQPSO) is a new kind of Particle Swarm Optimization, and it to raise up the accuracy, diversity, and robustness. 
The MOQPSO is based on the particle updating model: quantum double-potential model and the new strategy: local learning strategy. 
MOQPSO is able to find several solutions of multi-objective functions, so this quality can find several solutions, including the best one, for high-dimension functions: a neural network. 
To lead MOQPSO to a correct converge, the rule of rebuilding NN structure and objective functions have to define. 
Thus, nodes deletion rule for feedforward neural networks is introduced to simplify the complexity of the network.
